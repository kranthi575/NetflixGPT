steps to follow while creating redux store

#1 create the appStore

        configureStore( reducer:{});

#2 create the slice

        createSlice();

    add name
    add initial state of the slice
    add reducers (actions/methods to perform on the slice state)

    export all the actions inside the reducer
    export const {}=slice.reducer;

    export the reducer
    export default slice.reducer

#3 import the slice reducer into appstore(#1)

    import sliceReducer(you can give any name here) from "path of the slice";

    add the imported slice reducer to the reducer map in appstore


#4 Now redux store is ready to use in our app

    configure our redux store in the main application component
    using the provider

    <Provider store={appStore}>
        <app component />
    </Provider>
